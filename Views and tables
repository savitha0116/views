Table 
  A table is a database object that physically stores data.
Characteristics
  Stores actual data on disk
  Data is persistent
  Supports INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  Requires storage space
  Independent object

View 
  A view is a virtual table created using a SQL query.
  It does not store data (except materialized/indexed views in some DBMS).

Characteristics
  Stores only the SQL query
  Data is retrieved dynamically from base tables
  Used for security, abstraction, and simplicity
  Usually limited DML operations
  Depends on underlying tables
